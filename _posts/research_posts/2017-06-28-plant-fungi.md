Constructing a stable, beneficial, and functional complementary microbial community is of importance in many
aspects of life. It can be applied in fields such as human gut microbiome, agricultural application, and
environmental restoration. We are investigating interactions between plants and their fungal symbionts under
varied environmental and biological conditions. We seek to use the obtained data to construct a quantifiable
system allowing us to manipulate microbial communities suitable for conditions where to be applied.
We are using plant Arabidopsis thaliana and combinations of three proven beneficial fungal endophytes
(Colletotrichum tofieldiae, Cladophialophora chaetospira, and Piriformospora indica) to study their interactions
under phosphorus sufficient / deficient conditions in different plant developing stages.
